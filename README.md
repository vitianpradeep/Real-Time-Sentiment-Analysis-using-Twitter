# Real-Time-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Twitter


### I recently completed a mini project on real-time sentiment analysis on Twitter data. I used the Twitter API to collect tweets about a particular event and analyzed the ### sentiment of the tweets using an NLP tool. I was able to track public opinion on the event in real time and identify trends in sentiment over time. This project was a valuable ### learning experience and I am excited to continue exploring this area of research.
